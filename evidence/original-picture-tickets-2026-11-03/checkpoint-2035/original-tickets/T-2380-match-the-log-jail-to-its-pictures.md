Match the log jail to its pictures.

Owner, 2026-10-11: "if you have an image you should work towards it until it's a photographic representation of any images even drawings are ok, but it should look exactly perfectly like the image or drawing"; "redo any work already done to meet this high standard"; "you don't wrap the case until it matches the photo".

This building was built without being checked against its pictures (inventory of 2026-10-11, T-2368; compared before: partial). Open every picture listed here and read the building off the picture itself. Solve each one's camera into `data/reference_views/<structure_id>/<view>.json`, render with `node tools/photo_match.mjs`, and rebuild until the side-by-side shows nothing the picture shows differently: massing, bays, every opening's shape and height, ornament, cornice, porch and stoop, roof and chimneys, fence, materials and tone (AGENTS.md rule 11; `data/reference_views/README.md`). What the picture does not show stays reconstructed and recorded in `docs/LIBERTIES.md`.

Pictorial sources are tier 5: form only, never a coordinate. Several are drawn from memory or later (Andreas 1884, Kurz & Allison 1893), and some post-date 1835 (each is evidence of its own date, scene 1835-07-01, AGENTS.md rule 3): the build follows what each shows of the building as it stood then, and the match record says which picture governs where they disagree.

Pictures:
  picture: `chicago/reference/images/chicago/chicago_cook_county_jail_1836.jpg`
  picture: `chicago/reference/images/chicago/chicago_first_courthouse_1835.jpg`

**Acceptance:** every reference view of the building(s) below has its camera, its side-by-side from the GLB in the tree, and a match record with verdict `matches` and nothing open. The PR carries the before and after side-by-sides, plus desktop and 390x780 in-app shots with no page errors.

## Picture-review checkpoint — 2026-10-22

Pictures show a tall jail behind a palisade plus a low keeper's house; model is a low 6.096×4.572 m outbuilding. Catalogue dates the jail compound to 1836, so resolve identity/date before replacing July 1835 geometry.

No matching verdict or completion is claimed. See the [shared compound-render checkpoint](https://github.com/kevinrhaas/chicago/blob/steward/t3040-fort-reference-groups/chicago/4d/docs/RESEARCH/fort-reference-groups-T-3040/README.md) for source/date findings and the next implementation step.

**Released 2026-10-23** (claim of jail-picture-match-agent 10/23/2026, 7:24:30 AM CT): Owner-requested session-wrap handoff; original two-picture scope remains open and DIFFERS. Prior actual compound and corrected UNSELECTED/UNRUN pilot archived at https://github.com/kevinrhaas/chicago-evidence/blob/64fd5de/evidence/image-match-2026-10-22/final-parallel-recovery-20261023T1430/RECOVERY.md . No canonical jail geometry adopted. Camera, chronology, missing details and closed-gate collision limits remain documented; continue original image gate with real rendered comparisons.
